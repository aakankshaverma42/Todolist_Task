Implementation Details:

React.js Framework: The project leverages React.js for its intuitive and reactive user interface development capabilities. React.js components are utilized to create modular, reusable UI elements, facilitating efficient development and maintenance.

JSON Server: JSON Server is employed to simulate a RESTful API for data storage and retrieval. Custom endpoints are created to handle CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on task data. This backend setup enables seamless integration with the React.js front-end application.

Filtering and Sorting: The application incorporates filtering and sorting functionality to enhance user experience. Users can filter tasks based on completion status or sort them by creation date, enabling customized task viewing according to their preferences.

Local Storage: Browser local storage is utilized to persist user data across sessions. Task data is stored locally, allowing users to access their task lists even after closing and reopening the application. This ensures data integrity and continuity in task management.
